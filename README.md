# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

![Hotel](hotel_image.jpg)

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing hotel booking data to optimize pricing strategies and reduce cancellations. By identifying key variables affecting reservation cancellations, actionable insights are suggested that could lead to more efficient pricing and promotional decisions. Notably, logistic regression models were developed separately for both city hotels and resort hotels to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Data Preparation

- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Analysis

- Explored booking trends, seasonality, and customer demographics.
- Analyzed the relationship between booking cancellations and different features.

## Predictive Modeling

### Logistic Regression for City Hotels

- Developed a logistic regression model specific to city hotels.
- Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

### Logistic Regression for Resort Hotels

- Developed a logistic regression model specific to resort hotels.
- Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results and Insights

- Logistic regression models achieved an accuracy of X% for city hotels and Y% for resort hotels.
- Insights include recommendations for pricing and promotional strategies for both hotel types.
